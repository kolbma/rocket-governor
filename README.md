## Description

Implementation of the [Governor](https://github.com/boinkor-net/governor.git) rate limiter for [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) web framework.

Rate limiting is used to control the rate requests are received and handled by an endpoint of the web application 
or web service.

## Rocket specific features

Define as many rate limits with [Quota](https://docs.rs/governor/latest/governor/struct.Quota.html) of Governor
as you like and need in your Rocket web application/service.  
It is implemented as a Rocket [Request Guard](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/requests/#request-guards) and provides
also an implementation of an [Error Catcher](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/requests/#error-catchers).  
The Error Catcher can be registered on any path to handle [`Status::TooManyRequests`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/http/struct.Status.html#associatedconstant.TooManyRequests) and provide HTTP headers in the response.

## Usage

Add dependencies to [rocket-governor](https://crates.io/crates/rocket-governor) crate to your _Cargo.toml_.

Implement `RocketGovernable` for a _guard struct_ as you like: 

```rust
use rocket_governor::{Method, Quota, RocketGovernable, RocketGovernor};

pub struct RateLimitGuard;

impl<'r> RocketGovernable<'r> for RateLimitGuard {
    fn quota(_method: Method, _route_name: &str) -> Quota {
        Quota::per_second(Self::nonzero(1u32))
    }
}
```

This requires to implement the method `fn quota(_: Method, _: &str) -> Quota`.  
You can vary your `Quota` on any combination of __method__ and __route_name__, but the returned `Quota` should be a _static-like_. It should __not change__ between invocations of the `quota()`-method with equal parameters.

There is a small helper function `nonzero(u32)` for creating Quotas in your `quota()`-implementation e.g.:
```rust
    Quota::per_second(Self::nonzero(1u32))
```

After implementing the minimal requirements of trait `RocketGovernable` you can add your _Guard_ to your route-methods like:

```rust
#[get("/")]
fn route_test(_limitguard: RocketGovernor<RateLimitGuard>) -> Status {
    Status::Ok
}
```

### Register Catcher

To handle HTTP Status 429 TooManyRequests there is an catcher-function implementation.

It is __called__ __`rocket_governor_catcher`__.  

Register it with `register(<path>, <catchers>)`-method of Rocket:

```rust
use rocket_governor::rocket_governor_catcher;

#[launch]
fn launch_rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .mount("/", routes![route_test])
        .register("/", catchers!(rocket_governor_catcher))
}
```

### Optional feature __limit_info__

There is the optional feature __limit_info__ which enables reporting about
rate limits in HTTP headers of requests.

The implementation is based on headers of
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers

The feature provides a default implementation of a Rocket fairing
which need to be used to get the HTTP headers set.

See API documentation for [LimitHeaderGen](https://docs.rs/rocket-governor/latest/rocket_governor/struct.LimitHeaderGen.html).

For usage depend on it in Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
rocket-governor = { version = "...", features = ["limit_info"] }
```

### Optional feature __logger__

There is the optional feature __logger__ which enables some logging output.

For usage depend on it in Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
rocket-governor = { version = "...", features = ["logger"] }
```
